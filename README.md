# Speech to Text Recognition

This project implements a web-based form filler using the Web Speech API, allowing users to input data by speaking. It recognizes specific keywords and fills the corresponding fields in a form dynamically, making it accessible and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes the Web Speech API to capture and process spoken input.
- **Dynamic Form Filling**: Automatically fills in form fields based on recognized keywords such as name, email, phone, and address.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user in case of any errors during speech recognition.
- **Results Display**: Shows the filled form data in a structured format upon submission.
